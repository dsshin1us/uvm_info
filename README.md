# Let's dive into UVM...

I decided to put some of my UVM understanding into a github page, so I can just point other verification engineers to a link in my github repo.  I'll start small and grow it over time hopefully.

If you find any mistakes, please leave a comment.  I would **really really** appreciate any learning from you readers as it will help me grow.

Much love. [see more](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/86386968/or-a-deep-hatred-you-know-who-you-are.jpg)
